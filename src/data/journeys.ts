 * The unified journey model — a faithful port of the web's lib/journeys/core.ts.
 * Pure: no storage, no network, no React.
 *
 * A journey is a container of days; days differ by KIND, not by engine. Before
 * this module the product ran two engines for one job: themed paths (scripture
 * days, verse links, a sādhana round trip, every day open) and the meditation
 * course (guided sessions, unlock chaining, mood check-ins, guest merge). Each
 * had what the other lacked, and the shared arithmetic existed in five copies.
 * Journeys keep both day kinds and give both sides the whole feature set.
 *
 * Keep this in step with MindKshetra/lib/journeys/core.ts — the server enforces
 * the same rules, and a client that disagrees will offer days the API rejects.
